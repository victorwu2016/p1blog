## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How company size affects people to strong agree job security?
2. How company type infulences people's feeling of job security?
3. For the people who strong agree job security, how about their job satisfication and salaries?

The files are related to one course ownd by Udacity, it is for practising purpose.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available: https://medium.com/@changshengwu/job-security-10a2240f8541.
Here is the conclusion: the people who are working in a private-held limited company or a company with 20-99 employees are most strongly agree job security. There is not much different on salary and job satisfaction for the people who think that job security is important.
